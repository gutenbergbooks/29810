<h2>GIRL SCOUTS</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">Pg 1</a></span></p>


<p><i>History of the American Girl Scouts.</i> When Sir
Robert Baden-Powell founded the Boy Scout movement
in England, it proved too attractive and too
well adapted to youth to make it possible to limit its
great opportunities to boys alone. The Sister organization,
known in England as the Girl Guides, quickly
followed it and won equal success.</p>

<p>Mrs. Juliette Low, an American visitor in England,
and a personal friend of the father of Scouting,
realized the tremendous future of the movement for
her country; and with the active and friendly co-operation
of the Baden-Powells, she founded the Girl
Guides in America, enrolling the first patrols in
Savannah, Georgia, in March, 1912.</p>

<p>In 1913 National Headquarters were established
in Washington, D.C., and the name changed to
Girl Scouts.</p>

<p>In 1915 the organization was incorporated with
the legal title, Girl Scouts, Incorporated.</p>

<p>In 1916 National Headquarters were moved to
New York and the methods and standards of what
was plainly to be a nation-wide organization became
established on a broad, practical basis.</p>

<p>The first National Convention was held in 1915,
and each succeeding year has shown a larger and
more enthusiastic body of delegates and a public
more and more interested in this steadily growing
army of girls and young women who are learning
in the happiest way to combine patriotism, outdoor
activities of every kind, skill in every branch of domestic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">Pg 2</a></span>
science and high standards of community
service.</p>

<p>Every side of the girl's nature is brought out and
developed by enthusiastic captains, who join in the
games and various forms of training and encourage
team work and fair play. For the instruction of the
captains, national camps and training schools are
being established all over the country; and the
schools and churches everywhere are co-operating
eagerly with this great recreational movement,
which they realize adds something to the life of the
growing girl that they have been unable to supply.</p>

<p>Colleges are offering fellowships in scouting as a
serious course for would-be captains, and prominent
citizens in every part of the country are identifying
themselves with local councils in an advisory and
helpful capacity. At the present writing, nearly
60,000 girls and more than 3,000 captains represent
the original little troop in Savannah&mdash;surely a satisfying
sight for our Founder and National President,
when she realizes what a healthy sprig she has
transplanted from the Mother Country!</p>

<p><i>Aims.</i> While the aims of Scouting are similar to
those of the schools, the church and the home, its
methods are less direct and success depends upon
the attraction which the program has for the girls.
Belonging to an organization, the uniform, such
novel activities as knot-tying, hiking, signalling and
drilling, the chance for leadership, the laws to which
they voluntarily subscribe and the recognition of
ability by the system of giving badges are the distinctive
elements of Scouting. They succeed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">Pg 3</a></span>
bringing about improved health, approved standards
of behavior towards others, a general arousing of
the imagination as well as practical knowledge.</p>

<p>The ideal background for the entire program is
cheerful companionship in the open.</p>

<p><i>Standards.</i> The standards of the Girl Scouts are
expressed in their Laws and Promise, their Motto
and Slogan which are as follows:</p>

<br />


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">Pg 4</a></span>The best results are obtained by emphasizing the
fact that these ways are the girl's own idea of the
way to live, her choice. Success in expressing one's
own ideas never fails to give satisfaction. Clever
parents and teachers make use of this. &ldquo;A Scout is
cheerful&rdquo; is a more effective method of influencing
a girl, for instance, than any amount of advice on
the subject.</p>

<p>It seems to be more and more difficult to induce
girls to learn or practice housework. For the average
woman this is still necessary, and the more advanced
schools have taken it up. For the girl whom
neither the home nor the school has been able to
reach, Scouting offers a most successful and attractive
means of getting the practical information to
the young generation. They will do for &ldquo;merit
badges,&rdquo; in other words, what they will not do for
their mothers or teachers.</p>

<p>An effective manner of upholding and exercising
these standards, is, as has been abundantly proved
by the great war, the uniform. Earning and proving
worthy of it stimulates child, girl and woman
alike. Uniform and ceremony, not overemphasized,
but duly insisted upon, have a profound significance
to the human race, and teach us to sink the individual
interests and raise the standards of the group.</p>

<p><i>Leadership and The Patrol System.</i> In general a
troop should not contain more than thirty or forty
girls. Many very experienced captains have larger
troops when they have several lieutenants to assist
them. The troops are divided into groups, or patrols
of eight and treated as units, each under its own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">Pg 5</a></span>
responsible leader. An invaluable step in character
building is to put responsibility on the individual.
This is done in electing a Patrol Leader to be responsible
for the control of her Patrol. Leaders should
serve a limited time and every girl in a patrol should
have the experience of serving some time during her
membership. It is up to her to take hold and develop
the qualities of each girl in her Patrol. It
sounds a big order, but in practice it works. With a
friendly rivalry established between patrols a patrol
esprit de corps is developed and each girl in that
patrol realizes that she is herself a responsible unit
and that the honor of her group depends on her
efficiency in playing the game. The patrol system
is an essential feature in Scouting. When this is
lost sight of and the attitude of a teacher is adopted,
making the troop a <i>class</i>, the vital spirit or meaning
of Scouting is missed entirely. Although a powerful
personality always can succeed with young
people, in individual instances, it would be impossible
to get enough of these people to make any impression
upon the thousands of girls in the organization.
Moreover, the average child is already
overloaded with things to learn. What nobody
teaches her is how to control herself, and thus learn
to control others and take her share of responsibility.
The whole Scouting technique is adapted to
exactly this idea and the patrol leader is the key note
of it.</p>

<p><i>The troop whose captain is (apparently) not managing
it, but whose girls manage themselves under
the Scout laws, is the ideal troop.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">Pg 6</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Court of Honor.</i> The Patrol Leaders and
their &ldquo;seconds&rdquo; form the &ldquo;Court of Honor,&rdquo; which
manages the internal affairs of the troop. Its institution
is the best guarantee for permanent vitality
and success for the troop. It takes a great deal of
minor routine work off the shoulders of the Scout
captain, and at the same time gives to the girls a
real responsibility and a serious outlook on the
affairs of their troop. It was mainly due to the
Patrol Leaders and to the Courts of Honor that the
British Boy Scouts were able to carry on useful work
during the war. The Court of Honor decides rewards
and punishments, and interprets rules in individual
instances.</p>

<p><i>Methods.</i> Not only should the activities be those
which they are not getting through other channels,
but they should be presented in ways which attract
the girls. It should never be forgotten that Scouting
is chosen by the girls because it <i>interests them</i>. Use
as bait the food the fish likes. If you bait your hook
with the kind of food that you yourself like, unless
you happen to have a natural affinity for young
people, it is probable that you will not catch many.
If the Scouting program fails to interest girls, they
will find something that does.</p>

<p>The program should be varied, and never iron-clad,
but adapted to fill the needs of the special girl.
Examples: Few city girls have much chance to be in
the country. An effort should be made to get them
out on hikes, and week-end camping trips. Some
homes and schools do not teach the girls such practical
things as cooking, bedmaking, while some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">Pg 7</a></span>
groups of girls have no conception of obligation to
other people or any sense of citizenship. In each
case, the wise captain attempts to discover the novel
activity, which besides being helpful, will attract the
girls. The wise captain does not expect girls to pay
great attention to any one subject for very long,
and does not teach or lecture. They get enough of
that in school. The captain is rather a sort of older
playfellow who lets the girl choose activities which
interest her and she will learn for herself.</p>

<p>Most of the activities will be of the nature of play.
Play is always a means to mental and physical
development. The best play leads towards adult
forms of leadership, co-operation, entertaining, artistic
execution and community service.</p>

<p>Any captain who finds herself judging her troop's
efficiency by the old fashioned system of examination
marks based on a hundred per cent scale, shows
herself out of touch not only with the Scouting
spirit, but with the whole trend of modern education
today. When the tendency of great universities
is distinctly toward substituting psychological
tests for examinations, when the United States
Army picks its officers by such tests, it would be
absurd for a young people's recreational movement
to wear its members out by piling such work on captain
and scout!</p>

<p>Examinations and tests should lay weight on what
can be <i>done</i> within time limits and in first class
form; also on the effort expended by the girls, and
not on what can be <i>written or recited</i>. Young people
love such tests&mdash;which relate closely to games&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">Pg 8</a></span>
they are of great practical value in daily life. They
are the tests we meet every day. They interest the
community to watch and experts are always ready
and interested to judge them. But nobody is interested
in examination papers, and school children and
especially captains should not be taxed with more
than the absolute necessity of proving a candidate's
fair grasp of the subject.</p>

<p>In this connection great latitude should be allowed
for the captain's knowledge of her girls and their
real ability and attitude. The girls are also good
judges of each other. Remember that the girl with
the best examination paper is not necessarily the
best Scout.</p>

<p><i>The Council.</i> The Patrol System, under the captain,
is the vital <i>inside</i> of Scouting: in order to tie
the organization closely to the community, the council
must be well selected, strong and active. An
ideal council should represent the best homes in the
community, the church and the school. Some leading
woman, whose acquaintance is wide, should most
certainly be on it, in order to help the captain out
with a list of people qualified to judge the merit
badges, for instance. Interested women who will
help in camps, hikes, sales, moving picture benefits,
rallies are most necessary, and the captain should
feel no hesitation in asking advice or help from her
council. At least one member whose daughter is in
the local troop should be a practical link between the
home and the troop, but all members should make a
point of understanding the principles and distinctive
methods of Scouting and see that they are carried
out in their locality.</p>
